# City Cellular Traffic Map (C2TM)

This repository gives detailed description about
[city-cellular-traffic-map dataset](https://github.com/caesar0301/city-cellular-traffic-map). You
can access the [CRAWDAD repository](#) from Dartmouth to download the data
directly. Please cite our paper below if this data contributes to you research
conclusions.

## Introduction

Traffic characteristics over space and time constitute an important aspect of
cellular networks in consideration of resource provision, traffic engineering
and system optimization. Despite recent progress in revealing temporal dynamics
and spatial inhomogeneity of cellular traffic, limited knowledge about traffic
dependence is gained. One of challenges comes from the absence of sustained
observations at a network-wide scale. To complement this gap, we make an
analysis on week-long traffic generated by a large population of people in a
median-size city of China. Here we contribute the basic dimensions of this data
to public communities to stimulate more research enthusiasm on this topic.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

Our analyses make use of request-response records extracted from HTTP traffic
at the city scale, consisting of individuals’ activities during a continuous
week (actually eight days from Aug. 19 to Aug. 26, 2012), with accurate
timestamp and location information indicated by connected cellular base
stations (BS). Each individual is detected by the hashed International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI).

To remain principle traffic characteristics and preserve user privacy from our
analysis simultaneously, we derive hourly statistics at base-station
granularity, which implies a maximum of N x M records (N the number of base
stations, M the number of recording hours) in this public version. Meanwhile,
under requests of our data provider, the real location information of network
infrastructure is also meshed, whereas the relative topology of underlying
network is remained for study of network optimization or more.

## Basic Dimensions

This public cellular traffic map contains two files, i.e., `traffic` and
`topology`. The former provides hourly traffic statistics for each base
station, while the latter stores the relative topology of underlying cellular
network. The time dimension is represented by Gregorian calendar, with the
starting point of each hour to denote following 60 minutes (Note: GMT+8 time
zone is assumed in the data). The relative location of base station is in
longitude/latitude form to facilitate some analysis with standard geographic
processing about great circle distance.

* Traffic trace file (1625680 rows, 5 columns)

> * BS: identity of each cellular base station in this public data.
> * Time_hour: hourly timestamp in UNIX epoch time (time zone GMT+8).
> * Users: the number of active users associated with specific base station and hour.
> * Packets: the number of transferd packets associated with specific base station and hour.
> * Bytes: the number of transferd bytes associated with specific base station and hour.

* Topology file (13296 rows, 3 columns)

> * BS: identity of each cellular base station in this public data.
> * Lon: relative longitude of given base station.
> * Lat: relative latitude of given base station.

## Visualization

To show basic dynamics of this data, we attach a heatmap animation (plotted by
[R](http://www.r-project.org/)) below for the urban area of measured
region. The packets column in `traffic` file is used to estimate the traffic
density over space, while a normalization over space and time dimensions is
involved to show up the dynamics more obviously.
